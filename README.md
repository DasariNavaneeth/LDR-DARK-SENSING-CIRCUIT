#LDR Dark Sensing Circuit

#📌 Overview
This project is a simple automatic light control circuit that uses an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) to detect darkness. When light levels drop below a certain threshold, the circuit automatically turns ON an output device such as an LED, buzzer, or relay.

#🧩 Components Used
LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)
Resistor (1k and 100k)
NPN Transistor (e.g., BC547 / 2N2222)
LED
Power Supply (9V)

#⚙️ Working Principle
In light, the resistance of the LDR decreases → the transistor stays OFF → LED/output remains OFF.
In darkness, the resistance of the LDR increases → the transistor switches ON → LED/output activates.

#✅ Applications
Streetlights
Garden/porch lights
Night lamps
Dark/dusk detection circuits
Security/alarm systems
